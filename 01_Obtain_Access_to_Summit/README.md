<h4>Activating a SecurID<sup>®</sup> Token (fob)</h4>
Follow the steps described below to set up your new SecurID Token (fob).

&nbsp;

<h5>NOTE: Your username is printed on the front of the yellow envelope that your RSA token came in</h5>

<ol>
 	<li>Initiate an SSH connection to home.ccs.ornl.gov using your OLCF username.
(i.e., <code>ssh userid@home.ccs.ornl.gov</code>)</li>
 	<li>When prompted for a PASSCODE, enter the 6 digits displayed on your token.</li>
 	<li>When asked if you are ready to set your PIN, answer with "y".</li>
 	<li>You will then be prompted to enter a PIN. Enter a 4- to 8-character alphanumeric PIN you can remember. You will then be prompted to re-enter your PIN.</li>
 	<li>A message will appear stating that your PIN has been accepted. Press enter to continue.</li>
 	<li>Finally, you will be prompted again with "Enter PASSCODE". This time enter both your PIN <u>and</u> the 6 digits displayed on your token before pressing enter.</li>
 	<li>Your PIN is now set and you are logged into home.ccs.ornl.gov.</li>
</ol>

If you prefer to watch a video to learn how to set a PIN for your new RSA token, please see this <a href="https://vimeo.com/229862977">link</a> from our Vimeo channel.

<h4>Using a SecurID<sup>®</sup> Token (fob) to Log In to Summit</h4>

Initiate a connection to Summit using your OLCF username: <code>ssh userid<i></i>@summit.olcf.ornl.gov</code>

When prompted for your PASSCODE, enter your PIN followed by the 6 digits shown on your SecurID<sup>®</sup> token before pressing enter. For example, if your pin is <code>1234</code> and the 6 digits on the token are <code>000987</code>, enter <code>1234000987</code> when you are prompted for a PASSCODE.
<div class="kb-warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> The 6-digit code displayed on the SecurID token can only be used once. If prompted for multiple PASSCODE entries, always allow the 6-digit code to change between entries. Re-using the 6-digit code can cause your account to be automatically disabled.</div>
